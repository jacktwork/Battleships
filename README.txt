This is a Game programming test.  

I used SOLID principles and one design pattern in this project.  

The SOLID principles were as follows.

S = created classes with single responsibilities.  Ex. Ship, Grid, Vector.
O = extended classes instead of modifies.  Ex. StandardGrid, StandardLocationFormat.
L = No alterations which would not rest well with Liskov.
I = created interfaces which only included absolute essentials and were concise.  Ex. IShip, IGrid.
D = created dependency abstractions.   Ex. AShip, ILocationFormat

The design pattern was the factory pattern.
The factory pattern was used to create ships.
